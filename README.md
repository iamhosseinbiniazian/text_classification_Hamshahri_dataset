# Text classification on Hamshahri Persian Dataset


This ia text classification on Hamshahri Persian Dataset by Python and Magpie package.In this project we used Magpie package in python to classify persian text documents to some categories.we usued Word2Vec model to embedding document word into numric matrix space and after that used CNN(Convolutional Neural Network) for classify these features to categrory labels. and all these done by the power of Magpie.
- Text classification
- word2vec model 
- Convolutional Neural Network
